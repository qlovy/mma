#### Introduction:
The goal of this project is to build a sport app for my training. I choose to use a PWAs App because I don't have to pass by the Apple Store or Google Play.
I choose Vue.js and Bootstrap because Vue make the creation of a PWA more simple. It's great to learn new things. For Bootstrap, he simplifies the creation of the design.
