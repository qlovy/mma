#### Introduction:
The goal of this project is to build a sport app for my training. I choose to use a PWAs App because i don't have to pass by the Apple Store or Google Play.
I choose Vue.js and Bootstrap because this simply me the creation of the PWA and all the animation, ... For Bootstrap, he simplifies the creation of the design.
