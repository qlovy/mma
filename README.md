#### Introduction:
The goal of this project is to build a sport app for my training. I choose to use a PWAs App because I don't have to pass by the Apple Store or Google Play.
I choose Vue.js and Bootstrap because Vue make the creation of a PWA more simple. It's great to learn new things. For Bootstrap, he simplifies the creation of the design.

### Todos

- [x] Change the program "PoussÃ©e" --> make it correct
- [x] Add program "Tirage" and "Jambes"
- [x] Remove the time after last exercise
- [x] Add warm-up
- [ ] make that the sound is like the sound of a timer on iphone , so the music can restart.
- [x] Change the exercice while the rest time ?
- [x] Show the state of series ?
- [x] upgrade the information (repetitions in seconds, ...) ==> do a function
- [x] add a button for skip an exercice (like a help button...)
- [x] add advice for each exercices
- [x] add a timer for exercise with time (more than 10 seconds)
- [ ] change the background color on the top and bottom on iphone
- [x] create components to simpify the App.vue (home page, exercise page, ...)
- [ ] make that we can skip a time recuperation / a serie
- [ ] make the icon menu in color when we are on it
- [x] use local storage for storing exercises
- [x] JSON file or text file for add new exercise of configure multiple exercise --> one the local storage is ok
- [x] add a menu with two categories (one for exercising and the other for settings)

### Ideas

- Create a tool for create sport program => this is possible by modifying the JSON file and then import it.
